Indexers are servers that store and index AirSwap orders. Indexers are often also implemented by market makers as it gives them first look at orders made by peers. APIs are implemented via JSON-RPC [over HTTP](https://www.jsonrpc.org/historical/json-rpc-over-http.html) or WebSocket. To be reachable by clients, servers run at public endpoints with [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) enabled.
