Makers run web servers that implement the RFQ and Last Look APIs using JSON-RPC [over HTTP](https://www.jsonrpc.org/historical/json-rpc-over-http.html) or WebSocket. To be reachable by clients, servers run at public endpoints with [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) enabled. To become discoverable, server URLs are added to the [Registry](deployments.md) smart contract, which is queried by clients.

If a URL is HTTPS, it is implied that the server supports the latest RFQ protocol at that endpoint. If a URL is WebSocket (`wss`) then the server communicates its supported protocols upon connnection. See the `initialize` method of the [Request for Quote](protocols.md#rfq) and [Last Look](protocols.md#last-look) protocols for details. WebSocket servers can support both RFQ and Last Look protocols.
